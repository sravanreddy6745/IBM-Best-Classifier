# IBM-Best-Classifier

In this notebook I have used all the classification algorithms that I have learned in Machine Learning with Python course authorized by IBM.

##In this project, we have used 4 different classification techniques namely:
1 K-Nearest Neighbours.
2 Decision Tree.
3 SVM classification.
4 Logistic Regression.
These 4 techniques are applied on the same classification problem. And then we determine the best classifier among them, based on which technique is the most accurate for the given problem. I

Accuracy is measured using methods like:

1 Jaccard similarity index.
2Log loss.
3 F1-score.
